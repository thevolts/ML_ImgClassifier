# ML_ImgVideoClassifier

This is a image classifier where we use the webcam to train the model with predefined images as A, B or C. Once trained when
any of these objects appear in front of the webcam, we get the image classified as A, B, C. We also get the probability of the 
prediction. 

Since the image classifier is built on TensorflowJS, you done need to install/compile anything. You can just execute the
index.html, enable the webcam, train and test.
